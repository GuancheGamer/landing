# Plutonium Aim Assist

<Alert variant="warning">

This feature is a work in progress, expect tweaks as time goes on.

</Alert>

To make the switch to PC easier for our Console friends we have introduced Aim Assist into the games. The PC versions of the games do not support Aim Assist directly.
T6 Aim Assist is coming first, with IW5 after that and T4 after that.

Server owners can disable Aim Assist for all players using the `sv_allowAimAssist 0` dvar.


## T6 Aim Assist
This Aim Assist was in the game however was disabled by Treyarch, we have simply re-enabled this. In theory it should be the same as on console. When Aim Assist is on your sensitivity should feel lower and your aim will slow down as you pass players. Spin in a circle to get a feel for this. 
The Aim Assist is meant to be barely noticeable to keep the hardcore PC players happy, they did help start the Plutonium Community after all.

* Be sure to enable your gamepad and Target Assist in your Gamepad controls menu in game.

* If the server you are on has Aim Assist forced off, you will see a padlock next to Target Assist.

## IW5 Aim Assist
This Aim Assist is custom made by Plutonium, this should feel similar to the Black Ops 1 Aim Assist on console.

## T4 Aim Assist
This Aim Assist will be custom made by Plutonium and will likely be similar to Plutonium IW5 Aim Assist.
