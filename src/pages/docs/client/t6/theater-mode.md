# How to play back demos (Theater Mode)

<Alert variant="warning">

This currently only work's for Private Matches. This is because servers have no way to transfer demos to everyone's PC. We are working on a cloud solution to this.

</Alert>

## Recording Demos

* When you start your game up, verify that `demo_recordPrivateMatch` is set to 1. You can set it by opening the console using the tilde key ```~```  and then typing ```demo_recordPrivateMatch 1```.
