# Can I go to Max Rank without having to grind?

Of course you can, if you just want to jump right into things do the following:

* [Open the Console](/docs/opening-console)  
* Type `UnlockAll` and then press enter.  
* Open the server browser, join any server and play until you load into a different map.  
* Once the next map has loaded, quit the server and change your classes.  

UnlockAll doesn't unlock quite everything on T6, we are aware.

<Alert variant="warning">

Be sure to play until the next map loads or your classes won't save!
