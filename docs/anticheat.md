# Anticheat

Plutonium has an in-house anti-cheat that is on par with (or exceedes!) some triple A studios' anti-cheat. While we cannot divulge information on how it works, we can confidently say that it works as we have thwarted over
[20,000 cheating attempts!](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/10225/anticheat-1-year-statistics)

## Plutonium Cheat Policy

It is important you read and understand the following policy in regards to our anticheat system. 

**Upon detection of a Cheat:**

* Automatic ban of 7 days is placed onto the account.
* When the player tries to login, they will be displayed a message which tells them they are banned and also tells them how long is left until the ban expires.
* Attempting to bypass the ban in any way will lead to further restrictions. 
* Once the ban length has expired, the system will automatically remove the ban.
* If the player is caught cheating again, the system will ban the account permanently.
* We will not provide any information regarding any given ban, remember you broke our rules.

**Note**
The anticheat is always active even in solo play / private match.  
If you wish to cheat in private / solo you can use the [launchers LAN mode](#how-to-disable-the-plutonium-anti-cheat) which disables online functionality and disables the anticheat.  

The anticheat will be triggered by the following but not limited to:

* Injections
* External tools and cheats
* GSC Injectors
* Rank Unlockers
* Class editors
* FoV/FPS changer programs

All official supported modding is safe including our built in GSC support. 

## How to disable the Plutonium anti-cheat

Click the triangle next to the play button to disable anticheat.

Please note, as stated above this is for private use or in LAN mode. You will not be able to use our service to connect to servers while you have anti-cheat disabled.
