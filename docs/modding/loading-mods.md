[GSC Toolkit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j_ocjFCQsFaWqF2-PfdoJt2nF_EpNL_G/view?usp=sharing) (Required to compile your script)

__Example Scripts__

- [Jugg for joining players](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/112/jugger-for-new-players-joining-at-or-after-round-8-zombies)
- ["A cat has 9 lives"](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/449/mob-of-the-dead-mod-a-cat-has-9-lives)

### Getting Started
1\. You can write/download any GSC of your choice. If you are writing it from scratch/have the source code, note that you will need to compile it, which we will talk about in this post.

::: warning
If you are writing your own GSC, you must have an `init()` or `main()` function somewhere. This function is called the 'entry point', and it's a function the game engine is familiar with and will call.
:::

2\. For this tutorial, we are going to be writing and using this GSC as a reference.

```cs
init() // entry point
{
    level thread onplayerconnect();
}

onplayerconnect()
{
    for(;;)
    {
        level waittill("connected", player);
        player thread onplayerspawned();
    }
}

onplayerspawned()
{
    self endon("disconnect");
    for(;;)
    {
        self waittill("spawned_player");
        self iprintlnbold("^2GSC from %LocalAppdata%\\Plutonium\\storage\\t6\\scripts\\mp\\test.gsc ^1(Compiled)");
    }
}
```

3\. Using the GSC Compiler (from GSC Toolkit), simply drag and drop your raw GSC script ontop of `Compiler.exe` and it should spit out a compiled version.

3a\. If you get an error, make sure your script isn't already precompiled (open it, and if it looks like gibberish, it is already compiled)

3b\. Take your compiled script and put it in `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\mp` or `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm` depending on which mode it is for.

**(YOU MOST LIKELY WILL NOT HAVE THIS FOLDER, PLEASE CREATE THEM IF THAT IS THE CASE)**  

4\. When launching your server or a custom game, you will know if all has gone well or not if the console prints `Custom script 'scripts/mp/yourScriptName' loaded`.

5\. Enjoy your new GSC script!

## IW5

### Getting Started⠀

1\. Navigate to the IW5 Plutonium Folder by pressing `Win+R` and pasting `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\iw5` into it, and hitting `Ok`.

2\. Create a new folder here called `scripts`.

3\. Put any amount of GSC file(s) in here, I will be using the following code as an example.

::: warning
If you are writing your own GSC, you must have an `init()` or `main()` function somewhere. This function is called the 'entry point', and it's a function the game engine is familiar with and will call.
:::

```cs
init() // entry point
{
    level thread onplayerconnect();
}

onplayerconnect()
{
    for(;;)
    {
        level waittill("connected", player);
        player thread onplayerspawned();
    }
}

onplayerspawned()
{
    self endon("disconnect");
    for(;;)
    {
        self waittill("spawned_player");
        self iprintlnbold("^2GSC from %localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\iw5\scripts\example.gsc");
    }
}
```

4\. Verify your GSC looks like mine, and is in the correct location.

5\. Open MW3, and start a new Private Match, your GSC script should load.

### Loading Mods / Custom Zombies Maps

We support both the vanilla game folder and the Plutonium folder for mod loading.

::: danger
Currently, the `CoDWaW\mods` folder is buggy, please move your mods to the `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4\mods` folder to avoid things like menu corruption, or GSC errors.
:::

You can place your mod in either of these places:
* `%localappdata%\Activision\CoDWaW\mods`    **[BUGGY ATM, MOVE YOUR MODS/MAPS FROM HERE TO THE DIRECTORY BELOW.]**
* `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4\mods`   **(Recommended)**

**We suggest using the Plutonium folder where possible though, if you crash due to a mod, try moving it to the Plutonium Mods folder instead.**

If you are installing a custom zombies map that comes in an `.exe`, just running it and installing that way should be enough, as they place those in the first folder, although again, you might need to move it if you encounter issues.

**Note:** Mods for multiplayer must have `mp_` at the front of their folder.

### Loading Custom Maps (MP)

We support both the vanilla game folder and the Plutonium folder for loading client-side custom multiplayer maps.

You can place your mod in either of these places:
* `%localappdata%\Activision\CoDWaW\usermaps`
* `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4\usermaps`   **(Recommended)**

Once the map is installed, you must load a mod first. You can do something simple like `/fs_game mods/mp_custommaps; vid_restart` followed by `/map mp_yourmapname` and it should load right up.
